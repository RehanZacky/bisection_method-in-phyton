In the code above, we use the equation function to compute the value of the equation 
Then, we call the bisection_method with the interval [-2, 0] and a tolerance of 0.0001 to find the root of the equation. 
The root that is found is rounded to 4 decimal places as per the requested precision. 
Additionally, we have set a maximum iteration limit of 100 to ensure that the iteration stops if a solution is not found after a sufficiently large number of iterations.
